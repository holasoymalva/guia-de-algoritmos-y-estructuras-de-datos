#### Problem1
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Result: 3

#### Problem2
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Result: 23
